# Luke Gorrie's blog

Howdy!

My name is [Luke Gorrie](http://lukego.com/) and the [Issues](https://github.com/lukego/blog/issues) here are where I blog.

I'm busy building tooling for Bayesian analysis of complex software benchmarks. More on that later!

I have worked with a bunch of technologies (Lisp, Erlang, Emacs, LuaJIT, Smalltalk, Forth, ...) on a bunch of projects (Permo, Snabb, SLIME, RaptorJIT, TeraStream, Studio, Distel, ...) at a bunch of companies (Permo, Snabb Solutions, Teclo Networks, OLPC, Synapse, Bluetail.)
